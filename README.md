This code implements the calibration method described in "A Physics-based Noise Formation Model for Extreme Low-light Raw Denoising" paper. Since the original project,[ELD](https://github.com/Vandermode/ELD), only provides the denoising process and some key details are missing, the project is made for throughly understand the process of calibration method from the paper.
